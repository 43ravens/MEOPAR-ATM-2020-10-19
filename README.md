2020 MEOPAR ATM session "Python: f-strings and Q&amp;A" on 2020-10-19

## Learning Goals

* Explain what a Python f-string is
* Write f-strings
* Use f-strings as an aid to debug Python code
* Format variable values in f-strings
* Use f-strings to compose structured file paths/names


## Notebooks

* ### [Python-f-strings-Slides.ipynb](https://github.com/43ravens/MEOPAR-ATM-2020-10-19/blob/main/Python-f-strings-Slides.ipynb)
    Slides notebook from the session.
    This notebook uses the [Rise](https://rise.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) notebook extension to be both a notebook and a slide-deck.

* ### [Python-f-strings-LiveCoding.ipynb](https://github.com/43ravens/MEOPAR-ATM-2020-10-19/blob/main/Python-f-strings-LiveCoding.ipynb)
    This is the live-coding notebook from the session with a few post-session annotations.
